# in this example:
# - you determine archive file classes by their extension
# - unpack the archive to allow recon to act on files within the archive
source:
  # walk files from the "src/" folder
  root: "recon/src/"

    # array of extensions to test against to tell recon this file is an archive
    is_archive:
